<h2 align="center"> Code Institute / User-Centric Frontend Development. First milestone Project</h2>

This first milestone project we had the chance to impliment the knowledge we learn so far and to build a static website with minimum 3 pages.
I took the chance in building a 5 pages Coffee Shop website. In my mind, being a barista at the moment, this project should look very chill, informative in what kind of blends coffee house is using, the origins of the blends, what push and inspired the opening of this Coffee House.
Site have a menu page wich should display the best selling products with good images and informative information about the product. As well, a gallery page is required to show the amazing fresh, tasty and quality of the house products, (The gallery pictures I decided to be static).
On the last page, when a quest click the page he should feel that he is important for the house and will find a contact us form first, then scrolling down he will meet the team wich workes there.
Last thing, wanted the footer on 4 out of five pages to be similar and just on contact form to be different and to indicate the address, phone numbers, a google map and opening hours.
The place is designed for a small family business wich are in love with the magic of coffeine and the process of baking their own cakes as well a small their own Roastery.
The website is easy to navigate, so it is easy for customer to find his needs buy navigate from page to page, where he will encounter a well elaborated information, to locate, to call, find online presence and what he can enjoy buy visiting the place.
